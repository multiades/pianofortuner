# Your piano deserves the best care

Looking for a professional tuner for your piano (or more accurately, pianoforte)? Proper maintenance and regular tuning (at least once a year) is the key to an wholesome, crystal clear sound.

## About me

![Alexander Kepelian tuning a piano](/assets/images/alex.jpg)

My name is Kepelian Alexander, I am a pianist and a certified piano tuner. Playing the piano since the age of 10, under the guidance of various teachers, eventually led me in attending the music school of
Alimos. In addition, I took up piano tuning because of my grandfather's involvement with it. The next milestone in this direction was being certified in piano tuning and maintenance by the center of experiential
learning "Ekpedeftiki Enosi" in Athens.

## About my grandfather

My grandfather, Melixe Kepelian, was a pianist and accordionist in Syria for many years. When he arrived in Greece in 1981, he decided to take up tuning 
and maintainance of the musical instrument he so much adored. He succeded after excessive personal effort, studying the principles of tuning and putting them into practice,
while making use of the musicality and acoustic skills he had acquired during his lifetime. He was an exceptional practitioner of the craft, as evidenced by by the heartfelt references to his name
by people in the field even today,  although his activity has ceased for many decades now.
